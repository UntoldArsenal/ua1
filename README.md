# UntoldArsenal Analysis Support

UntoldArsenal members occassionally want to work on ideas involving or about Arsenal Football Club, that are a little clunky for the blog interface.  Such as a shared source code project or football database support.  This Github repository is an attempt to fill that need.

## Getting Started

This template is one I grabbed from elsewhere, and I am just making minimal changes to get things started.

The first piece to come up here, is a simple model which can model a football league (Association Football, such as the English Premier League).  It is written in Perl, and makes use of some modules from CPAN.  At the moment, I am assuming that people that come here, understand what CPAN is, and have installed modules from CPAN in the past.
